# cars-finder
This project, specifically developed for An-Najah National University, is an online platform aimed at addressing the issue of improper parking within the university's parking facilities and streamlining security and organizational verification processes. The project utilizes Flask and advanced libraries like WTF and SQLAlchemy. Despite its simplicity, it serves as a significant platform for applying the concepts and skills acquired in the field of web application development using these technologies.

The project allows university members to input the vehicle registration plate number, granting them quick and efficient access to the vehicle owner's data, such as name and contact information. This platform is designed to enhance the experience of university members within parking facilities and facilitate security and organizational procedures, thereby contributing to the creation of a more efficient and secure university environment.
